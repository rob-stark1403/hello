Cryptanalysis involves breaking cryptographic systems to decode encrypted data without a key. It identifies weaknesses in encryption techniques to access hidden information.

The Playfair cipher, proposed in 1889, is a symmetric encryption method that encrypts digraphs (letter pairs) using a 5x5 key matrix. One letter (usually J) is omitted, and it falls under digraph substitution ciphers.

Advantages:
Complicates cryptanalysis
Resists brute force attacks
Easy substitution
Limitations:
Only 25 letters
No numeric, special, or media file support
Playfair Cipher Rules:
Prepare Plaintext: Split into digraphs, add "Z" if odd letters, replace repeating letters with "X."
Key Matrix: Create a 5x5 matrix using a keyword and remaining letters of the alphabet.
Encryption:
Same Row: Replace each letter with the letter immediately to its right. Wrap around to the start of the row if necessary.
Same Column: Replace each letter with the letter immediately below it. Wrap around to the top of the column if necessary.
Different Row and Column: Replace each letter with the letter in the same row but in the column of the other letter of the digraph.

Decryption reverses these steps.

CONCLUSION : 
We learned how to decrypt encoded messages by reversing the encryption process. This exercise helps in understanding the mechanics of substitution ciphers and the importance of key management in cryptographic systems.

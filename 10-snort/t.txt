Aim: Study Network Security by setting up Snort and analyzing different logs.

Network Security Overview  
Network security protects data integrity, confidentiality, and availability by using tools that monitor and detect suspicious activities, helping prevent unauthorized access and threats.

Snort Overview  
Snort is an open-source Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) that monitors network traffic in real time, detecting attacks based on predefined rules. Key features include:

- Packet Sniffing: Captures network traffic.
- Real-Time Analysis: Identifies suspicious behavior.
- Rule-Based Detection: Detects threats using known attack signatures.
- Alert Generation: Notifies admins of potential threats.

Snort Modes  
1. Sniffer Mode: Displays network traffic.
2. Packet Logger Mode: Logs traffic for analysis.
3. Network Intrusion Detection Mode (NIDS): Compares traffic against rules to detect attacks.

Types of Attacks Detected  
Snort can detect various attacks such as:

- DoS (Denial of Service)
- Port Scans
- Buffer Overflows
- SQL Injections

Logs and Their Importance  
Snort generates logs that record attack details, which help administrators identify threats, monitor traffic, and develop security strategies.

Conclusion  
Setting up Snort enables real-time network monitoring and detection of threats, helping to improve network security by analyzing logs and preventing attacks.

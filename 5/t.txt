When encrypting long messages with AES (128-bit block size) or DES (64-bit block size), different modes of operation are used to securely transform plaintext into ciphertext. Here's a brief overview of common modes:

1. Electronic Codebook (ECB) Mode
How it works: Each block of plaintext is encrypted independently.
Weakness: Identical plaintext blocks produce identical ciphertext blocks, making it insecure for long messages due to pattern leakage.
Use case: Small, fixed-length data (not recommended for long messages).
2. Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Mode
How it works: Each plaintext block is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted. The first block uses an initialization vector (IV).
Strength: Errors propagate to the next block, enhancing security. Patterns are obscured.
Use case: Commonly used for encrypting files and data streams.
3. Counter (CTR) Mode
How it works: Converts a block cipher into a stream cipher. A counter value is encrypted and XORed with the plaintext.
Strength: Can encrypt blocks in parallel, supports random access to encrypted data.
Use case: High-performance applications and network security protocols.
4. Cipher Feedback (CFB) Mode
How it works: Operates like a stream cipher. Each plaintext block is XORed with the output of the encryption of the previous ciphertext.
Strength: Errors propagate less than CBC, and the encryption process can handle smaller block sizes.
Use case: Real-time encryption (e.g., streaming).
5. Output Feedback (OFB) Mode
How it works: Similar to CFB, but instead of the previous ciphertext, an encrypted IV is used for each block.
Strength: Avoids error propagation and ensures synchronization.
Use case: Suitable for error-prone channels (e.g., satellite communications).
AES vs DES
AES is preferred due to stronger security (larger key sizes: 128, 192, 256 bits) and better efficiency. DES, with its 56-bit key, is now considered insecure for modern applications but provides a foundational understanding of block ciphers.
For long messages, AES with CBC or CTR is commonly used for security and performance.

Conclusion : 
Using appropriate modes of operation with AES and DES significantly enhances their security and performance, especially when dealing with long messages. Modes like CBC and CTR are widely preferred for their balance of security and efficiency.

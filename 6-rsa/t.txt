The RSA cryptosystem, invented in 1977 by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman, is a public-key cryptosystem used for secure data transmission. It relies on the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers, allowing for encryption and digital signatures, ensuring secure communication and authentication.

Steps in RSA Algorithm:
Key Generation:

1. Select two large primes p and q.
2. Compute n = p * q.
3. Calculate φ(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1).
4. Choose a public exponent e (usually 65537).
5. Calculate the private key d, the modular inverse of e modulo φ(n).

Encryption:

Ciphertext C = M^e mod n (where M is the plaintext).

Decryption:

Plaintext M = C^d mod n (using the private key).

Wireshark
Wireshark is a powerful network analysis tool used to capture and analyze network traffic in real-time. It operates in both promiscuous mode (captures all traffic on the network) and non-promiscuous mode (captures only traffic to/from the local machine).


Promiscuous vs Non-Promiscuous Mode
Promiscuous Mode: Captures all packets on the network interface, regardless of their destination.
Non-Promiscuous Mode: Captures only packets that are destined for or originated from the local machine.

Filtering Packets
Wireshark allows filtering of captured packets based on various criteria like protocol, IP address, and port numbers:

Protocol filter: http (filters HTTP traffic).
IP address filter: ip.addr == 192.168.1.1 (filters traffic to/from a specific IP).
Port number filter: tcp.port == 80 (filters HTTP traffic on port 80).

CONCLUSION:
Wireshark effectively captures and analyzes network traffic, offering insights in both promiscuous and non-promiscuous modes. By applying various filters, users can isolate specific traffic for deeper analysis, making it a valuable tool for network diagnostics and security monitoring.
